MY VACCINATION CARD
--------------------------
Digital vaccination card to store vaccination history and move away from reliance on incomplete medical records.

Problem: NHS paper medical records
-----------------------------------
* NHS do not digitally share patients' medical records when they switch doctors. Records must be physically sent to a central distribution location and then forwarded onto a new location.

* This often leads to patients having an incomplete vaccincation history when reocrds are lost in transit.
